OS_ATS has served us great since the beginning, but I aim for the final product to be unique and innovative.  
Unfortunely OS_ATS have several limitations such as:  

  ·Custom Indicator limited to 0-9, Ins, Del, Home, End, PgUp and PgDn  
  ·The lack of ATS Sound control  
  ·Cross platform etc.  
  This is why I have made my own LRVSystem plugin. This plugin is specifically designed for Light Rail Phase IV, some of its features include:  

  ·Crash animation when crashing into the previous trains  
  ·Utilize other key such as space bar  
  ·Sound of direction indicator  
  ·Works on Windows/macOS/Linux  
Now it's the year 2021, and we continue to focus on route/train features. The new LRV Plugin will allow players to control the train number, safety system and animations. An window specifically designed for route 705 is also planned in the future, this also allows for stuff like tutorial mode with markers that can be toggled.
